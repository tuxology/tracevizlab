In this lab, you will install Trace Compass on the machine you'll use to view the traces.

*Pre-requisites*: A viewing machine, it does not have to be a Linux machine.

Sub-task 1: Install Java > 8

Trace Compass is an Eclipse-based application and needs at least Java 8 to run. Make sure you have the correct version.

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_172"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_172-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.172-b11, mixed mode)
```

If the java command is not found or you have an older version of java installed, you need to install java. On an ubuntu machine, it would be

```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_171"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-8u171-b11-0ubuntu0.18.04.1-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode)
```

If the version is still not correct, you may need to update your default java version using the following command

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java      1101      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java      1101      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: **2**
```

Sub-task 2: Get Trace Compass

Go to the [Trace Compass web site](http://tracecompass.org) and click on the big green button to download the latest release of Trace Compass. Then extract the content of the downloaded archive and simply start trace-compass from the extracted folder

$ tar xf trace-compass-3.3.0-20180307-1910-linux.gtk.x86_64.tar.gz
$ cd trace-compass
$ ./tracecompass 
```
