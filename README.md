### Trace Visualization tutorial

This repository contains a series of labs and guides for collecting traces, from the operating system or userspace applications or cloud environments, and visualizing them with trace visualization tools.

While most of the labs will use [LTTng](http://lttng.org) for trace collection and [Trace Compass](http://tracecompass.org/) for visualization, some labs may use other tools.

This tutorial is divided into labs, with each lab having their specific goals and objectives. The labs are composed of various tasks to achieve the goal. In the lab's README, there will be a suggestion of navigation for the task. There will also be sample traces and screenshots for each lab.
